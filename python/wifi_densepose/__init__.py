"""WiFi-DensePose — passive human sensing from WiFi CSI.

ADR-117 — v2.0 is a PyO3-bound replacement for the legacy pure-Python
``wifi-densepose==1.1.0`` (released 2025-06-07). The compiled core is
the same Rust workspace published in `v2/crates/` of the
`ruvnet/RuView <https://github.com/ruvnet/RuView>`_ repository.

Quick start::

    import wifi_densepose
    print(wifi_densepose.__version__)
    print(wifi_densepose.__rust_version__)
    print(wifi_densepose.hello())   # → "ok"

P1 (this release): scaffold. Core types land in P2; vital signs +
signal DSP in P3; WebSocket/MQTT client in P4. See the
`ADR-117 modernization plan
<https://github.com/ruvnet/RuView/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-117-pip-wifi-densepose-modernization.md>`_
for the full phase ledger.

Migrating from v1.x: the v1 line was pure-Python and had a different
API surface. v2 is a hard break (semver-justified). See the
``v1.99.0`` tombstone wheel for the migration URL.
