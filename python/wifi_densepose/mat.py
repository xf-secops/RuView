"""MAT — Mass Casualty Assessment Tool (ADR-024 crate, ADR-185 P3).

WiFi-based disaster-survivor detection and START-protocol triage from CSI:
ingest CSI frames, run a scan cycle, and query detected survivors by triage.

Included in the official ``wifi-densepose`` wheels. It is absent only from a
from-source build that did not enable the Rust ``mat`` feature; rebuild with
``maturin ... --features mat`` (or ``--features sota``) in that case.

Quick start::

    from wifi_densepose.mat import DisasterConfig, DisasterResponse, DisasterType, ScanZone

    cfg = DisasterConfig(DisasterType.Earthquake, sensitivity=0.9, confidence_threshold=0.1)
    resp = DisasterResponse(cfg)
    resp.initialize_event(0.0, 0.0, "Building A")          # required before scanning
    resp.add_zone(ScanZone.rectangle("North Wing", 0.0, 0.0, 50.0, 30.0))
    for amp, phase in csi_stream:
        resp.push_csi_data(amp, phase)
    resp.scan_once()                                        # one detection cycle
    for s in resp.survivors():
        print(s.id, s.triage_status, s.confidence, s.location)

Honest scope (ADR-185 §3.4): the ADR's Rust-side `scan_once()` wrapper was
unnecessary — this binding drives one cycle of the public async
`start_scanning()` (with `continuous_monitoring` forced off) on an internal
runtime. `initialize_event` + `add_zone` are required before `scan_once`.
`Survivor.latest_vitals` returns the latest reading (the Rust accessor is a
history). The detection pipeline is real but unvalidated on live rubble.
