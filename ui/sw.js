// RuView Service Worker - Offline caching for the dashboard shell
// Strategy: Network-first for API calls, Cache-first for static assets

// Bumped from v1: an older SW cached `/oauth/status` cache-first, so browsers
// that ran it hold a permanently signed-out answer. `activate` deletes every
// cache whose name is not CACHE_NAME, so bumping is what evicts it from clients
// already in the field. Bump again if a future change poisons the cache.
const CACHE_NAME = 'ruview-v2';

// Requests whose response depends on the caller's credentials. These must never
// be served from the Cache API.
//
// The Cache API is NOT the HTTP cache: it ignores `Cache-Control` completely, so
// the `no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate` the server already sends on
// `/oauth/status` has no effect here. A cached signed-out response was returned
// to the page forever, and only a hard reload — which bypasses the service
// worker entirely — showed the true state. (ADR-271.)
const NEVER_CACHE_PREFIXES = ['/oauth/'];

// What may be served cache-first. Previously cache-first was the *catch-all* for
// everything outside `/api/` and `/health/`, which meant any endpoint added at a
// new path was frozen on first response. An allowlist fails safe instead: an
// unrecognised path goes to the network untouched.

/**
 * Network-only, with an explicit offline signal.
 *
 * This used to cache every successful `/api/` response and replay it whenever
 * the network failed. Two things are wrong with that now:
 *
 * 1. **Authorization.** API responses are per-user once auth is on, but the
 *    cache is keyed by URL alone and nothing purges it at sign-out. Sign in as
 *    A, load sensing data, sign out, sign in as B, lose the network — B is
 *    served A's data with no authorization check at all. That is the same
 *    defect class as the cached `/oauth/status`: the Cache API happily outlives
 *    the session that produced its contents.
 * 2. **Correctness.** This is a live sensing dashboard. Replaying a stale pose
 *    or presence reading as if it were current is its own defect — it can show
 *    a room as occupied after the person has left.
 *
 * The offline shell (HTML/CSS/JS) is still cached; only the data is not. If
 * offline data replay is wanted back, it needs a per-session cache key and a
 * purge on sign-out, not a URL-keyed shared cache.
