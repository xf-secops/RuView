// Single-use WebSocket tickets (ADR-272).
//
// A browser's WebSocket constructor cannot set an `Authorization` header on the
// upgrade request. That used to mean the sensing WebSocket stayed reachable
// with no credential even when the server had auth switched on — the REST
// control plane was locked while the live sensing stream was open.
//
// The server now gates `/ws/*` and `/api/v1/stream/pose`. Browsers exchange
// their stored bearer token at `POST /api/v1/ws-ticket` — an ordinary request,
// where headers DO work — for a short-lived, single-use ticket, and pass that
// as `?ticket=` on the socket URL.
//
// Why a token in a URL is acceptable here when it normally is not: the ticket
// is consumed on first use, lives ~30 seconds, and authorizes one WebSocket
// and nothing else. It cannot be replayed against /api/v1/*. The long-lived
// bearer token is still never put in a URL.
