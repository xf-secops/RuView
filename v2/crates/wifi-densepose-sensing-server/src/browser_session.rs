//! Browser sign-in: `GET /oauth/start` → Cognitum → `GET /oauth/callback`
//! → a signed session cookie (ADR-271, browser half).
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! `wifi-densepose login` writes `~/.ruview/credentials.json`. **A browser
//! cannot read that file.** So until now the UI had no way to obtain a Cognitum
//! token at all — the WebSocket ticket mechanism ADR-272 built "for browsers"
//! was only exercisable with the legacy static shared secret that OAuth was
//! meant to replace. An adversarial review found the gap; this closes it.
//!
//! # The pattern, ported from `cognitum-one/freetokens`
//!
//! freetokens (`src/auth/oauth.ts`, live at `freetokens.cognitum.one`) solves
//! exactly this, and the shape is worth stating because it is not the obvious
//! one:
//!
//! **The browser never holds an OAuth token.** The server generates the PKCE
//! verifier and state, keeps them in a signed cookie, performs the code
//! exchange itself, verifies the token, and then issues *its own* session
//! cookie. The access token never reaches page JavaScript, so it cannot be
//! read by an XSS, stored in `localStorage`, or leaked through a URL.
//!
//! # Deviation from freetokens, and why
//!
//! freetokens uses the `__Host-` cookie prefix, which **requires** the `Secure`
//! attribute. It is served only over HTTPS, so that is free. RuView is
//! routinely reached over plain HTTP on a LAN or at `http://localhost`, where a
//! `__Host-`/`Secure` cookie is simply never sent and sign-in would silently
//! fail. So the names carry no prefix and `Secure` is set only when the request
//! arrived over TLS. Every other attribute — `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`,
//! `Path=/` — matches, and the signature is what actually protects the value.
