//! Boots the REAL `sensing-server` binary and probes BOTH listeners.
//!
//! # Why this test exists
//!
//! Two authentication bypasses shipped in the ADR-272 work, and 526 green unit
//! tests could not see either, because every auth test in this crate builds its
//! OWN `Router` with a hand-picked subset of routes. A synthetic router can
//! never observe how the real one is assembled — and both defects were assembly:
//!
//! 1. The dedicated WebSocket listener (`--ws-port`) was constructed with only
//!    host validation. `require_bearer` was never applied to it at all. That is
//!    the port the shipped UI actually connects to
//!    (`ui/services/sensing.service.js` maps HTTP 8080 -> WS 8765), so the
//!    earlier fix protected a path the browser never takes.
//! 2. `/ws/field` was `.merge()`d AFTER the auth layer on the HTTP router. In
//!    axum a layer wraps only what is already registered, so merging afterwards
//!    silently exempts those routes.
//!
//! Both were found by adversarial review, not by the suite. This test closes
//! that gap: it runs the actual binary, so it sees the actual wiring.
//!
//! It deliberately asserts on **ports and transports**, not on handler logic —
//! handler behaviour is covered by the unit suites. What is unique here is that
//! nothing is synthetic: real process, real listeners, real TCP.
