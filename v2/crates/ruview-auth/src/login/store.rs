//! Stored credentials and the refresh critical section.
//!
//! # Why refresh is the dangerous part
//!
//! Identity **rotates refresh tokens with reuse detection**: presenting one
//! returns a replacement and spends the original, and presenting a spent token
//! revokes the whole session family. So the two obvious implementations are
//! both wrong:
//!
//! * *Refresh concurrently* — two tasks present the same token, the second
//!   looks like replay, and the user is logged out.
//! * *Retry a failed refresh with the same token* — a timeout is not evidence
//!   the server didn't consume it. Retrying is precisely the replay the server
//!   is watching for.
//!
//! [`Session::ensure_fresh`] therefore holds an async mutex **across the
//! await**, re-checks expiry after acquiring it (the task that waited may find
//! the work already done), persists the rotated token **before** returning, and
//! never retries.
//!
//! ## The in-process mutex is not enough
//!
//! Every CLI invocation is a NEW process with its own `Session` and its own
//! mutex, all sharing one credential file. Two `wifi-densepose` commands run
//! close together inside the refresh window would each load the same refresh
//! token and each present it — and the second is replay, so the user is logged
//! out for running two commands at once.
//!
//! So the critical section is also guarded by an advisory **file lock**, taken
//! NON-BLOCKING. If another process holds it, that process is already
//! refreshing: we wait briefly and re-read the file rather than queue up to do
//! the same work with a token that is about to be spent. Blocking on the lock
//! would also park the async executor — the same mistake this crate had to fix
//! in `jwks.rs`.
